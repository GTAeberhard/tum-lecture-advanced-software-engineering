\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Early prototyping}
Early research and pre-development phases of development are able to
implement a working system using off-the-shelf PC-like Hardware
(e.g. x86 architecture with Linux).

TODO: Show example of such hardware in a prototype vehicle
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Early Embedded Hardware}
Talk about what early embedded hardware looks like, e.g. evaluation boards,
etc. --> also mentioned starting to go to microcontrollers, if required, or
RTOS. Give examples with pictures.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Production Hardware}
Talk about automotive-grade hardware from Tier 1s
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Designing for safety and performance}
Talk about different type of cores required in a final hardware architecture,
e.g. microcontrollers, safety cores, hardware acceleration, security, etc.

Mentioned that software should abstract all of this away --> but this is a big
challenger (mentioned what Apex.AI is doing to solve this)
