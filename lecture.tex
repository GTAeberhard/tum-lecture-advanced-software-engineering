\section{introduction}

\include{introduction}
\include{history}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Software Challenge}
Modern vehicles are smartphones on wheels and the next generation vehicles
will automated the driving task.\\
$\Rightarrow$ Software is taking over the automotive industry
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dozens of ECUs in a modern vehicle
    \item High-resolution displays for the drive and passenger
    \item Sensors detect the vehicle's environment
    \item Actuators automatically control many vehicle functions
    \item Thousands of software developers from many companies collaborating
    \item Safety of utmost importance
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Software Challenge}
\framesubtitle{Autonomous Driving}
Show that the translation of input to output is done with software
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Phases of Development}
Autonomous vehicles and ADAS development has traditionally followed three phases
of development.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research: Develop prototypes to understand the use-cases, algorithms,
        hardware, etc. $\rightarrow$ is the product feasible?
    \item Pre-development: Iron out the details, requirements, commercial
        viability, etc. $\rightarrow$ develop a solid blue print for production
    \item Production: Software and hardware is hardened and optimized for
        production quality and cost, meeting any required safety, automotive or
        product standards
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{}
The autonomous driving industry today is making the transition from
pre-development to production.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Architecture}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Architecture}
The architecture of a system can be broken down into different levels of
detail.

TODO: Show as a pyramid or layered picture?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional Architecture: Logical components and sub-systems, along
        with a high-level definition of interfaces, are identified
    \item Software Architecture: Implementation of logical components into
        concrete software components with concrete interface implementations
    \item Hardware Architecture: Partitioning of the software components onto
        specific hardware and defining the low-level communication mechanisms
        of the components
\end{itemize}

The different phases of development will focus on different levels of
the architecture and hence specific details of the system.
\end{frame}

\include{functional}

\subsection{Software Architecture}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Software Architecture}
Show layered architecture, e.g. HW, OS, Middleware, Framework, Apps
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Software Architecture}
Talk about how functional components are implemented into software:
AUTOSAR, ROS, etc.

Talk also about the development tools required to implement a software 
architecture
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Prototyping in the ROS Framework}
Talk about how a prototyping framework like ROS is useful
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Production Software Frameworks}
Talk about how what is required to go from prototyping to a production
software architecture (Apex.OS, AUTOSAR, other --> name the properties
of such frameworks)
\end{frame}

\subsection{Hardware Architecture}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Early prototyping}
Early research and pre-development phases of development are able to
implement a working system using off-the-shelf PC-like Hardware
(e.g. x86 architecture with Linux).

TODO: Show example of such hardware in a prototype vehicle
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Early Embedded Hardware}
Talk about what early embedded hardware looks like, e.g. evaluation boards,
etc. --> also mentioned starting to go to microcontrollers, if required, or
RTOS. Give examples with pictures.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Production Hardware}
Talk about automotive-grade hardware from Tier 1s
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hardware Architecture}
\framesubtitle{Designing for safety and performance}
Talk about different type of cores required in a final hardware architecture,
e.g. microcontrollers, safety cores, hardware acceleration, security, etc.

Mentioned that software should abstract all of this away --> but this is a big
challenger (mentioned what Apex.AI is doing to solve this)
\end{frame}

\section{Implementation}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Continuous Integration / Deployment}
Talk about CI, e.g. what happens from commit to deployment
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Working Model}
V-Model, Waterfall, Agile, etc.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standards}
Talk about standards, e.g. ISO 26262, cybersecurity AUTOSAR C++ 14, MISRA, etc.
