\frametitle{The Software Challenge}
Modern vehicles are smartphones on wheels and the next generation vehicles
will automated the driving task.\\
$\Rightarrow$ Software is taking over the automotive industry
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dozens of ECUs in a modern vehicle
    \item High-resolution displays for the drive and passenger
    \item Sensors detect the vehicle's environment
    \item Actuators automatically control many vehicle functions
    \item Thousands of software developers from many companies collaborating
    \item Safety of utmost importance
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{The Phases of Development}
Autonomous vehicles and ADAS development has traditionally followed three phases
of development.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research: Develop prototypes to understand the use-cases, algorithms,
        hardware, etc. $\rightarrow$ is the product feasible?
    \item Pre-development: Iron out the details, requirements, commercial
        viability, etc. $\rightarrow$ develop a solid blue print for production
    \item Production: Software and hardware is hardened and optimized for
        production quality and cost, meeting any required safety, automotive or
        product standards
\end{itemize}
\pause
\begin{block}{}
The autonomous driving industry today is making the transition from
pre-development to production.

\frametitle{Architecture}
The architecture of a system can be broken down into different levels
of detail.\\
TODO: Show as a pyramid or layered picture?\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional Architecture: Logical components and sub-systems, along
        with a high-level definition of interfaces, are identified
    \item Software Architecture: Implementation of logical components into
        concrete software components with concrete interface implementations
    \item Hardware Architecture: Partitioning of the software components onto
        specific hardware and defining the low-level communication mechanisms
        of the components
\end{itemize}
The different phases of development will focus on different levels of
the architecture and hence specific details of the system.
